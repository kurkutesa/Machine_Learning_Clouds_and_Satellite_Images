## About the repository
The goal of this repository is to use image segmentation techniques to models capable of build masks for different types of cloud formations.

**Help us remove the haze from climate models and bring clarity to cloud identification.**

For more information on the scientific background and how the labels were created see the following [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01906).
